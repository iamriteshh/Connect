# Abstract

The application has integrated ERP system where student can get all the information related to academics like attendance , credits earned , CPI performance , scores and much more on his/her fingertip. All the latest update regarding college like Workshops/Guest Lectures/News/Updates will be available at one place. 

Information related to online classes like assignment update , classroom link , professor's details all are integrated at one place by the help of Google Classroom API. Students can also find and get connected to their alumni through this application very easily. Stay updated by knowing the latest update around the world.

There is option to form community in the application , through which students belonging to the same university can connect with each other and form a community based on their interest. This feature will help to reduce the interaction gap among different students studying in same university , because it is very difficult to find and interact with people having same interest and belonging to same university in other social media platform like LinkedIN.
